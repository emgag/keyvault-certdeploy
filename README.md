**keyvault-certdeploy** is a helper tool used to facilitate X.509 certificate deployment to Linux VMs with [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/). Unlike the built-in method via VM secrets, it does support RSA and ECDSA certificates, local deployment and update hooks. It can be used to push certificates to Key Vault from a Let's Encrypt deployment hook and to refresh VM certificates on boot or to periodically poll for updates via cronjob. 

## Requirements

* [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault) vault and an account with write permissions to vault secrets (for uploading new certs) and a read-only secret permissions for fetching certs. 
* Go >=1.11 for building.  

## Limitations

To support importing ECC keys and ECDSA certificates, it does not use Key Vault's internal mechanism for key and certificate management and stores key and certificate in a single PEM-encoded secret. Thus, it cannot be used with HSM-backed keys or Key Vault's automatic certificate renewal.

## Authentication

keyvault-certdeploy uses the [automatic environment authentication from the Azure Golang SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/go/azure/azure-sdk-go-authorization#use-environment-based-authentication) to authenticate itself to Key Vault. Credentials can be either provided through environment variables or, if running in a Azure VM, through [Managed Service Identity (MSI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-service-identity/overview). No environment variables need to be set when using MSI.

Required access policies to vault:
* To push certificates: Secret Get & Set
* To fetch (dump & sync) certificates: Secret Get
* To list certificates: Secret Get & List

## Configuration

See [keyvault-certdeploy.yml.dist](keyvault-certdeploy.yml.dist) for a sample configuration. 

## Usage

```
X.509-Certificate deployment helper for Azure Key Vault

Usage:
  keyvault-certdeploy [command]

Available Commands:
  dump        Dump certificate and key from vault to current directory or dir, if supplied
  help        Help about any command
  list        List certificates in vault
  push        Push a certificate to the vault
  sync        Sync configured certificates from vault to system
  version     Print the version number of keyvault-certdeploy

Flags:
  -c, --config string   Config file (default locations are $HOME/.config/keyvault-certdeploy.yml, /etc/keyvault-certdeploy/keyvault-certdeploy.yml, $PWD/keyvault-certdeploy.yml)
  -h, --help            help for keyvault-certdeploy
  -q, --quiet           Be quiet
  -v, --verbose         Be more verbose
```

### dump

```
Dump certificate and key from vault to current directory or dir, if supplied

Usage:
  keyvault-certdeploy dump <subject> <keyalgo> [flags]

Flags:
      --cert string               Name of the leaf certificate file (default "cert.pem")
      --chain string              Name of the certificate chain file (default "chain.pem")
  -d, --dir string                Directory to save files to (default ".")
      --fullchain string          Name of the full certificate chain file (default "fullchain.pem")
      --fullchainprivkey string   Name of the full certificate chain + private key file (default "fullchain.privkey.pem")
  -h, --help                      help for dump
      --key string                Name of the private key file (default "privkey.pem")
```

The files generated by this command follow the same convention as common Let's Encrypt utilities like [certbot](https://github.com/certbot/certbot) or [dehydrated](https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated):

* `privkey.pem`  : the private key for the certificate.
* `fullchain.pem`: the certificate file containing all CA certificates as well as the leaf certificates. That's usually the one to use in TLS configurations of the services (e.g. in nginx's `ssl_certificate`)
* `chain.pem`    : the CA certificates only, e.g. for OCSP stapling.
* `cert.pem`     : just the leaf certificate. 

See [certbot's documentation about this](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#where-are-my-certificates) for more info.

Additionally, following files will be generated as well:
* `fullchain.privkey.pem` : the concatenation of fullchain and privkey.

### list

```
List certificates in vault

Usage:
  keyvault-certdeploy list [flags]
```

This command will list all certificates in configured vault.

### push

```
Push a certificate to the vault

Usage:
  keyvault-certdeploy push <privkey.pem> <fullchain.pem> [flags]
```

To push a certificate to the vault, the push command requires a key- and a certificates file. It's designed to work with the PEM files generated by Let's Encrypt utilities (privkey.pem & fullchain.pem).

### sync

```
Sync configured certificates from vault to system

Usage:
  keyvault-certdeploy sync [flags]

Flags:
  -f, --force     Force update even if version on disk matches the one in vault
  -h, --help      help for sync
      --nohooks   Disable running hooks after cert update
```

This command will fetch all certificates configured in the `certs` list in the config file and run hooks if a certificate was updated. Hooks will only run once per sync run, after all certificates are processed. Duplicate hooks are ignored.

## Vault format

Certificates are pushed to the vault as an unencrypted, single PEM-formated file containing the ECC or RSA private key, the chain certificates and the leaf certificate. The secret is named SubjectCN-PublicKeyAlgo (all lowercase, e.g. example.org-rsa), its content type is set to _application/x-pem-file_ and following tags are defined:

* fingerprint: SHA256 fingerprint (hex-encoded string)
* keyalgo: Either _ECDSA_ or _RSA_
* notafter: UNIX timestamp of the certificate expire date
* subjectcn: The certificate's subject common name


## Build

### On Linux

```
$ mkdir keyvault-certdeploy && cd keyvault-certdeploy
$ export GOPATH=$PWD
$ go get -d github.com/emgag/keyvault-certdeploy
$ cd src/github.com/emgag/keyvault-certdeploy
$ make install
```

will download the source and build binary called _keyvault-certdeploy_ in $GOPATH/bin.

### Using Docker

```
$ docker build -t keyvault-certdeploy:latest .
```

will build a Docker image.
